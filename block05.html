          American alligators live in the wild in the southeastern United
          States. You're most likely to spot them in Florida and Louisiana,
          where they live in rivers, lakes, ponds, swamps, bayous, and marshes.
          These reptiles are kind of clumsy on land, but they're built for life
          in the water. Great swimmers, they are equipped with webbed feet and
          strong tails that propel them through the water.

          Giraffes are found in the dry savannahs of Africa, where they roam
          among the open plains and woodlands.

          In the wild, there are two formally recognised lion subspecies. The
          African lion (Panthera leo leo) is found in Africa, south of the
          Sahara desert. The Asiatic lion (Panthera leo persica) exists in one
          small population around Gir Forest National Park in western India.

          Monkeys are primates found primarily in tropical rainforests. Most are
          arboreal, though some, like macaques and baboons, are terrestrial. New
          World monkeys, like spider monkeys, tamarins, and capuchins, are found
          in Mexico and South and Central America, while Old World monkeys,
          including baboons, gelada, and colobus, are found in Asia and Africa.
          Many species of monkeys are endangered.

          American alligators once faced extinction. The United States Fish and
          Wildlife Service placed them on the endangered species list in 1967.
          Fortunately, the legal protection worked. Just 20 years later,
          American alligators were taken off the list.
